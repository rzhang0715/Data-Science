# Analysis on Impact Scores of Certified B Corporations in the Apparel, Footwear & Accessories Industry
## *Abstract*
Impact Scores of Certified B Corporations were introduced to qualify the sustainable business among corporations. We are concerning about the multi-variables related to the impact scores of Certified B Corporations from United States and out of United States. We use Q-Q plot and chi-square test to test normality and identify outliers, apply the principal component analysis and factor analysis to reduce dimension of the data. Two sample t-test is used to test there are differences between sustainable performance of corporations in United States and out of Unite States. Simultaneously confidence intervals are examined the inequality of sustainable performance in different area of corporations all over the world. Regression tree is used to classify corporations with various sustainable performance to help us handle missing data. Unlike considering the data itself, we also concerned data with outliers and without outliers to understand how outliers affect our analyzing results under same method. This analysis will help us easily assign a new data to a group and the company will know their competitors in the same group.

#### Key words: Classification, B Corporation, Multi-variable, outliers

## *Introduction*
With the increasing attention on sustainability from various sectors, like manufacturers, consumers and governments, performing a sustainable business seems like an imperative and beneficial effort for enterprises to succeed in a competitive environment. Sustainable business refers to a business that strives to meet the triple bottom line (environment, social and economic). Evaluation on the sustainable performance of enterprises is a key issue, and some certifications existing to assist enterprises getting better understand on their sustainable performance and communicating with shareholders. B Corp Certification is one of these certifications used to measure a company’s governance, entire social and environmental performance. A certified corporation’s overall B impact score consists of five area, governance, workers, community, environment and customers. Since the evaluation on sustainable performance is still a hot and relative new topic, there is limited knowledge sustainable performance, it is needed to get a general insight on various companies’ sustainable performance.

## *Methodology*
Data was collected originally by the authors from the website of Certified B Corporation. Considering the interests of the authors, only the data of companies in the apparel, footwear & accessories industry was collected. There were 92 related corporations listed in the B Corp Directory and they were divided into two groups, corporations in the United States (Sample 1: 43 observations) and out of the United States (Sample 2: 49 observations). And there were six variables, including overall B Impact Score, Governance Score, Workers Score, Community Score, Environment Score and Customers Score. Data points collected in US and out of US were named as “US data” and “World data” separately for processing the same methods on all analyzing
methods except point out in the whole methodology section. These methods will be applied to analyze this dataset as followings:
Data preparation: As all data were collected from two different regions, in US and out of US, some companies may not provide all necessary data for all 6 variables (overall B Impact Score, governance, workers, community, environment and customers). Data points with missing information will be removed to avoid possible mis-leading results.
Normality assessment and outlier detection: Two independent samples (US data, World data) after cleaning up will be applied on the normality assessment separately. All single variable of each sample will be tested by performing Shapiro tests with Q-Q plot; And multivariate tests will be applied with response variable (overall score) and without response variable. Multivariate tests will be performed by Royston’s test with a chi-square plot. Outliers will be identified by Mahalanobis distance observed in chi-square test.
Principal component analysis will be used to reduce the dimensionality and to identify the crucial variables for the response for the overall B impact score. As there are total 6 variables include one response variable (overall B impact score), which will not be considered on principal component analysis. All other variables could be written as a linear combination as 𝑌𝑖=𝑎𝑖1𝑋1+⋯+𝑎𝑖𝑝𝑋𝑝=𝑎𝑖𝑇𝑋 and the total will be calculated by 𝑇𝑉=𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑌1)+⋯+𝑉𝑎𝑟(𝑌𝑝). The variance of each variable will be checked and scaled for standardization to achieve a precise result. The standardized data will be applied for principal component analysis by using procomp function in R. The least number of PCs to retain for 70% variance, and each loading will be extracted for specify each PCs. The data with outliers and without outliers will be performed on principal component analysis to compare with each other to see if any influence by outliers on principal component analysis.
